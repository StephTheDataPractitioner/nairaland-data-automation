# nairaland-data-automation
This project shows how to create an ETL pipeline that scrapes front-page data from Nairaland, retrieves post metrics from each detail page, sends the cleaned data to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, and connects it to Power BI for analytics and reporting. The final Power BI report is published,  and scheduled to refresh on a daily basis.
